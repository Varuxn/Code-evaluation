A teacher of abacus arithmetic in a certain school used a test method to quickly test the ability of abacus arithmetic addition. He randomly generated a set of positive integers, each with different numbers, and asked the students to answer: How many of these numbers are exactly equal to the sum of two other (different) numbers in the set?
Recently the teacher gave some test questions, please help to find out the answers.

solution main function
```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
    int solve(int n, vector<int> &num)
}
```

Pass in parameters:
1 integer, n.
An array with num containing n positive integers.

Return parameters:
An integer representing the answer to the quiz question

Example 1:
Input: n=4,num=[1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 2

Restrictions:
3≤n≤@data, 1≤num[i] ≤10000
Time limit: @time_limit ms
Memory limit: @memory_limit KB

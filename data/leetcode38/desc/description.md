Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sortedï¼ŒThe answer is modulo 998224353.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

solution main function
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int n) {

    }
};
```

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 15

Restrictions:
1 <= n <= @data

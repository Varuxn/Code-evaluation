Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

solution main function
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(string s) {

    }
};
```

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6

Restrictions:
1 <= s.length <= @data
s consists of lowercase English letters.

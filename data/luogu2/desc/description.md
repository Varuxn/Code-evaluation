In class, there are always some classmates who talk to people before and after, which is a headache for the head teacher in primary school. However, the head teacher Xiaoxue found some interesting phenomenon, when the students' seats are determined, only a limited number of $D$to the students will talk to each other in class.
In the classroom, the students sit in the $M$row $N$column, and the students sitting in the $j$column of the $i$row are in the position of $(i,j)$. In order to facilitate students to enter and exit, the classroom is set up a horizontal channel of $K$and a vertical channel of $L$.
So, the clever snow came up with a way that might reduce the problem of students talking to each other in class: she planned to rearrange the tables and chairs and change the position of the passage between the students' desks and chairs, because if a passage separated $2 students who could talk to each other, then they would not talk to each other.
Please help to write a program for Xiaoxue to give the best channel division scheme. Under this scheme, the number of students who talk to each other in class is the lowest.

solution main function
```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
    pair<vector<int>,vector<int> > solve(int M,int N,int K,int L,int D, vector<vector<int> > &seats)
}
```

Pass in parameters:
5 integers, $M,N,K,L,D$, meaning as shown on the surface.
seats A row of four integers $X_i,Y_i,P_i,Q_i$indicates that two students sitting at $(X_i,Y_i)$and $(P_i,Q_i)$will talk to each other (make sure they are next to each other or next to each other).
The input data ensures the uniqueness of the optimal solution.

Return parameters:
Two vector arrays
The first array contains $K $$a_1 integers, a_2, \ ldots, a_K $, said the first $line a_1 $and $a_1 + 1 $line, between the first $a_2 $, between line and $a_2 + 1 $... A channel is opened between the $a_K$and $a_K+1$lines, where $a_i< a_{i+1}$.
The second array containing $L $$b_1 integers, b_2, \ ldots, b_L $, said the first $b_1 $and $b_1 + 1 $row between, the first $b_2 $and $b_2 + 1 $row between,... A channel is opened between columns $b_L$and $b_L+1$, where $b_i< b_{i+1}$.

Example 1:
Input : M = 4, N = 5, K = 1, L = 2, D = 3 ,seats = [ [4, 2, 4, 3],  [2, 3, 3, 3],  [2, 5, 2, 4] ]
output : [ [ 2],[2, 4] ]

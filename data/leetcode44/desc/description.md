Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

solution main function
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int n) {

    }
};
```

Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2

Restrictions:
1 <= n <= @data
Time limit: @time_limit ms
Memory limit: @memory_limit KB
